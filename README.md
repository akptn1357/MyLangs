# MyLangs â€“ Language Localization Component for Delphi
MyLangs is a Delphi component designed to simplify and streamline the localization of multilingual applications.
It allows you to manage languages, assign translations, and track changes within forms and units in a structured and developer-friendly way.

ðŸ”§ Installation:
If an older version is installed, remove it from the IDE using the clean method.
Compile MyLangs_RT.dpk, then compile and install MyLangs_DT.dpk.

By tracking component additions, removals, and modifications on forms â€” as well as unit deletions and renaming â€” 
the component will become more efficient and user-friendly in future updates.
